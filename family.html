	<p> This is my family. Actually I do not have a complete picture with my actual family hehe. So I put the picture of my bigger family including with my Grandma, Aunty and also my cousins. To be honest, I am the oldest from 5 siblings which is 3 boys and 2 girls. My sister is also studying at UiTM in Diploma of Science at UiTM Arau, Perlis while the rest of the siblings are still studying at the high school. In this picture, my beautiful mother is in the back corner from the left while my dad is not in the picture hahaha. So thats all i can describe about my family. I would like to say that I love my family very much and I am nothing without them.   </p>
